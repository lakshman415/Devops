## Ansible Roles

### What are Ansible Roles?

Ansible roles are a way to organize and package automation content in a reusable and modular format. Roles provide a structured approach to breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

Roles typically consist of tasks, variables, handlers, files, templates, and other components necessary to perform a specific function or configure a specific aspect of a system.

### Creating an Ansible Role

To create an Ansible role, follow these steps:

1. Use the following command to initialize a new role structure:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy init my-role-name
   ```

   This command will create the necessary directory structure and files for your role.

2. Edit the files in the `tasks/`, `handlers/`, `vars/`, `files/`, and `templates/` directories to define the desired tasks, handlers, variables, files, and templates for your role.

3. Use the role in your playbooks by referencing the role name in the `roles` section of your playbook.

### Using an Ansible Role

To use an Ansible role in your playbook, follow these steps:

1. Create or update your playbook YAML file.

2. Define the hosts or groups on which the role should be applied.

3. In the `roles` section of the playbook, specify the role name:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: My Playbook
     hosts: my_hosts
     become: true

     roles:
       - my-role-name
   ```

4. Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
   ```
